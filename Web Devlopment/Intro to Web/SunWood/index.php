	<p>Floating in a sheltered harbor on Vancouver Island, the Sunwood Resort 
	is located on the west coast of the Island, in British Columbia, Canada; 
	the lodge is open from May to October and features a magnificent wraparound 
	sun deck and a cozy fireside library with panoramic views of the stunning 
	area. The region is home to an abundance of spectacular wildlife, including 
	the rare, white Kermode (Spirit) Bear. Two hours north of Vancouver and 
	accessible only by boat or floatplane, our 17-room luxury wilderness lodge 
	awaits you. Our all-inclusive experience allows us to custom tailor a program 
	so that you can enjoy all that the Lodge has to offer. You can relish in 
	the chance to fish, hike into the lush Rainforest, kayak along untouched 
	coastlines, view wildlife, experience cultural programs and indulge in soothing 
	spa experiences. After an exhilarating day, you will return to the lodge 
	to enjoy gourmet cuisine featuring local seafood, the finest organic ingredients 
	and award winning British Columbia wines. </p>
